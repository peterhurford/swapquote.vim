## swapquote.vim
**swapquote.vim** is a minimalist plugin for swapping quotes.  Swap all ' with " and all " with ' on the current line with `<Leader>'`

For example, if your leader is `\`, then `\'`, will change:

`'hello'`  ... becomes ... `"hello"`

`"#{variable}"` ... becomes ... `'#{variable}'`

If you do not like the default key mapping of this plugin, uninstall this plugin and put... 

```
noremap [Desired key mapping here] :s/['"]/\="'\""[submatch(0)!='"']/g<CR>
```

...into your `.vimrc`
